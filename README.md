How to make Window Things Easier to do for all the "Newbies" who want to do specific things!
 I have to search everwhere to learn how to do some of the simplest thing in Windows and have learned little along the way! One example is UEFI and do I need it and after researching it, can I repopulate it with a new installation of Windows and(still to learn) how to enter my OEM Windows Key and yet keep my Didital key-ONLY an example. These things should not be "HIDDEN" but made simple so that everyone can get the MOST from their Windows Experiemce!
